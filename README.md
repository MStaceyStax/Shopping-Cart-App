FNB Academy 2025 - App Development Bootcamp - Shopping Cart App in Python
Project -  Shopping-Cart-App
Key Features - I created a shopping cart app in Python that will calculate your list of shopping items and total everything once 
done. This will be able to provide you with the total figure and suggest how much you spend on your shopping. 
Process - The process was simple as I followed along with my learning material and made use of the Python fundamentals and functions being taught and implemented what I learnt. 
Tech Stack - Python
